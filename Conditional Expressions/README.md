# 🧠 Conditional Expressions in C

Welcome to this section of my **C Language Practice Exercises** repository.  
This folder focuses on **conditional expressions and decision-making statements**, which allow a C program to make choices based on given conditions.

---

## 📘 Overview

Conditional expressions control the **flow of execution** in a C program.  
They enable programs to perform different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false.

The exercises in this folder help build a strong understanding of:
- Decision-making logic
- Condition evaluation
- Writing programs that respond to user input and changing data

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 1. Relational Conditions
- Using comparison operators:
  - `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Evaluating conditions as true (1) or false (0)

### 2. Logical Conditions
- Logical operators:
  - `&&` (AND)
  - `||` (OR)
  - `!` (NOT)
- Combining multiple conditions

### 3. if Statement
- Simple `if` conditions
- Executing code when a condition is true

### 4. if–else Statement
- Two-way decision making
- Handling true and false cases

### 5. else if Ladder
- Multiple condition checking
- Selecting one outcome from many possibilities

### 6. Nested if Statements
- Conditions inside conditions
- Complex decision-making logic

### 7. switch Statement
- Multi-way selection using constants
- Use of `break` and `default`
- Difference between `switch` and `if–else`

### 8. Conditional (Ternary) Operator
- Syntax: `condition ? expression1 : expression2`
- Writing concise conditional expressions

## 🎯 Importance of Conditional Expressions

- Enable **decision-making** in programs
- Control program execution flow
- Essential for writing:
  - Interactive programs
  - Menu-driven applications
  - Logic-based solutions
- Widely used in real-world applications and competitive programming
- Foundation for loops, functions, and complex algorithms

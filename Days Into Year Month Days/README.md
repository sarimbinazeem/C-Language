## 🚀 Benefits of This Program

- 🧠 Helps in understanding **time conversion logic** — converting total days into years, months, and days.  
- 💡 Strengthens **problem-solving and logical thinking** by breaking a large value into smaller, meaningful parts.  
- 🔢 Demonstrates practical use of **integer division** (`/`) and **modulus operator** (`%`).  
- 🖥️ Enhances understanding of **input/output handling** using `scanf` and `printf`.  
- ⚙️ Builds a foundation for **real-world applications**, such as date or duration calculation in software projects.

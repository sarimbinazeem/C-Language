# 🔁 Loops in C

Welcome to this section of my **C Language Practice Exercises** repository.  
This folder focuses on **loops in C**, which allow a program to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met.

---

## 📘 Overview

Loops control the **repetition of code execution** in a program.  
They help automate tasks, reduce code duplication, and handle iterative processes efficiently.

The exercises in this folder help you understand:
- Repeated execution of code
- Loop control and iteration
- Writing programs that handle repetitive tasks dynamically

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 1. `for` Loop
- Executes a block of code a known number of times
- Syntax: `for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement)`
- Ideal for counted iterations

### 2. `while` Loop
- Executes a block of code **while a condition is true**
- Condition is checked **before** each iteration
- Useful for unknown iteration counts that depend on runtime conditions

### 3. `do-while` Loop
- Similar to `while`, but condition is checked **after** executing the loop body
- Ensures the loop runs at least once

### 4. Nested Loops
- Loops inside loops
- Used for multidimensional data, patterns, or complex iterations

### 5. Loop Control Statements
- **`break`**: Exits the loop immediately
- **`continue`**: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next
- **`goto`**: Jumps to a labeled statement (use sparingly)

## 🎯 Importance of Loops

- Automate repetitive tasks
- Reduce code duplication and improve readability
- Handle dynamic or unknown numbers of iterations
- Essential for writing:
  - Pattern printing programs
  - Data processing loops
  - Menu-driven and interactive applications
- Foundation for algorithms, arrays, and complex data processing

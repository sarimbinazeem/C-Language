# 🟦 Arrays in C

Welcome to this section of my **C Language Practice Exercises** repository.  
This folder focuses on **arrays in C**, which are used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. Arrays allow programs to efficiently manage, access, and manipulate collections of data.

---

## 📘 Overview

Arrays are **contiguous memory blocks** where each element can be accessed using an **index**.  
They simplify tasks such as storing student scores, processing multiple inputs, or handling large datasets without declaring separate variables for each item.

The exercises in this folder help you understand:

- Organizing data into collections  
- Accessing and modifying array elements  
- Iterating over arrays using loops

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 1. One-Dimensional Arrays
- Storing a list of elements (numbers, characters, etc.)  
- Accessing elements using an index (`array[i]`)  
- Examples: storing student marks, temperature readings  

### 2. Two-Dimensional Arrays
- Arrays of arrays (matrix or table-like structures)  
- Accessing elements using two indices (`array[i][j]`)  
- Examples: seating arrangements, multiplication tables  

### 3. Array Initialization
- Declaring arrays with fixed size or initializing with values  
- Examples: `int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};`  

### 4. Array Traversal
- Looping through elements to read, update, or process data  
- Using `for`, `while`, or `do-while` loops  

### 5. Common Operations
- Summing elements, finding minimum/maximum  
- Searching for a value  
- Copying or reversing arrays  

### 6. Multi-Dimensional Array Operations
- Nested loops for row-wise or column-wise processing  
- Pattern printing or matrix calculations

## 🎯 Importance of Arrays

- Store multiple related values efficiently  
- Simplify code by avoiding multiple variables  
- Enable easy processing with loops  
- Foundation for:
  - Strings and text processing  
  - Matrices and data tables  
  - Advanced structures like vectors, stacks, and queues

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

After completing the exercises in this section, you will be able to:

- Declare and initialize one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays  
- Access, modify, and traverse array elements using loops  
- Perform basic operations like sum, search, and reverse  
- Handle arrays in real-world scenarios like student marks, inventory, or seating arrangements  
- Avoid common mistakes like out-of-bounds access

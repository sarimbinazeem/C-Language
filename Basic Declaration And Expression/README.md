# 🧠 Basic Declarations & Expressions in C

Welcome to this section of my **C Language Practice Exercises** repository.  
This folder focuses exclusively on **basic declarations and expressions**, which are the building blocks of the C programming language.

---

## 📘 Overview

Basic declarations and expressions form the **foundation of C programming**.  
They define how data is stored, manipulated, and evaluated in a program.

The exercises in this folder are designed to help beginners understand how C programs:
- Declare variables
- Perform calculations
- Evaluate conditions
- Handle basic input and output

Mastering these concepts is essential before moving on to conditionals, loops, arrays, and pointers.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 1. Variable Declarations
- Declaring variables using:
  - `int`
  - `float`
  - `double`
  - `char`
- Variable initialization
- Rules for valid identifiers

### 2. Constants
- Use of the `const` keyword
- Difference between variables and constants
- Read-only values in programs

### 3. Input and Output
- Using `printf()` to display output
- Using `scanf()` to take user input
- Format specifiers such as `%d`, `%f`, `%c`

### 4. Arithmetic Expressions
- Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Expression evaluation
- Operator precedence

### 5. Relational Expressions
- Comparison operators:
  - `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Evaluating true (1) and false (0)

### 6. Logical Expressions
- Logical operators:
  - `&&` (AND)
  - `||` (OR)
  - `!` (NOT)
- Combining multiple conditions

## 🎯 Importance of Basic Declarations & Expressions

- They are the **first step** in learning C programming
- Help understand how data is stored and processed
- Essential for writing correct conditions and calculations
- Used in almost **every C program**
- Required knowledge for:
  - Conditional statements
  - Loops
  - Functions
  - Arrays and pointers

Without a strong understanding of these concepts, writing logical and error-free programs becomes difficult.

## 🚀 Benefits of This Program

- ⏱️ Improves understanding of **time conversion logic** through division and modulus operations.  
- 💡 Strengthens **problem-solving skills** by breaking a total value into smaller components (hours, minutes, seconds).  
- 🔢 Demonstrates the use of **integer division** (`/`) and **modulus operator** (`%`) in real-world scenarios.  
- 🧠 Enhances logical thinking and understanding of **data manipulation** in sequential steps.  
- 🖥️ Builds a foundation for **clock, timer, and duration calculation programs**.

## 📚 What I Learned

- ✅ How to use **division and modulus** operators to split values into meaningful parts.  
- ✅ The correct sequence of calculations to convert seconds → minutes → hours.  
- ✅ Reinforced understanding of **integer arithmetic** and **operator precedence**.  
- ✅ Learned how to format **time-based output** clearly using `printf`.  
- ✅ Improved my ability to write **step-by-step algorithms** for practical, real-world problems.

## 🧮 Topic: Basic Declarations and Expressions

### 📘 Description

This section covers the **fundamentals of the C programming language**, focusing on how variables are declared, initialized, and used in expressions.  
It includes simple programs that perform basic arithmetic, logical, and relational operations while emphasizing syntax structure and data types.

### 🧩 Concepts Covered

- Variable declaration and initialization (`int`, `float`, `char`, etc.)  
- Constants and identifiers  
- Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)  
- Logical and relational expressions (`&&`, `||`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`)  
- Type casting and order of evaluation  
- Input and output using `scanf` and `printf`  
- Understanding operator precedence and associativity

# 🟩 Functions in C

Welcome to this section of my **C Language Practice Exercises** repository.  
This folder focuses on **functions in C**, which help divide programs into smaller, reusable, and well-structured blocks of code.

---

## 📘 Overview

A function is a self-contained block of code designed to perform a specific task.  
Functions improve program readability, reduce repetition, and make debugging easier.

The exercises in this folder help you understand:

- Breaking large problems into smaller parts  
- Reusing logic through function calls  
- Writing clean and structured programs  

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 1. Function Declaration and Definition
- Declaring a function before use  
- Defining function logic  
- Syntax: `return_type function_name(parameters)`

### 2. Function Calling
- Calling functions from `main()`  
- Calling functions from other functions  

### 3. Function Parameters
- Functions with parameters  
- Functions without parameters  
- Actual vs formal parameters  

### 4. Return Values
- Functions that return a value  
- Using the `return` statement  
- `void` functions  

### 5. User-Defined Functions
- Creating custom reusable functions  
- Examples: sum, average, factorial, validation  

### 6. Scope of Variables
- Local variables  
- Global variables  
- Understanding variable visibility  

### 7. Passing Arguments
- Call by value  
- How data is passed to functions
